// Citymaker — zoning-first shop plots (s40).
//
// Playtest s40 (image 70): "There's a mismatch between what gets planned and where the zones actually are. Shouldn't it
// be snug against where it knows it can zone?" Hosts planned shop plots as free rectangles along the frontage; the
// zone cells the game gives a road sit on that road's own 8 m grid, so ZoneGuard zoned only the cells whose centres
// fell in a plot: cells covered part of a plot, poked out of others, some plots got none — paving notches, grass
// leftovers and gaps around the buildings that grew.
//
// Now the plots ARE the cells: the layouts still choose WHERE shops go (amount, pattern, depth, entrance gaps), then
// every candidate plot is replaced by the exact cells ZoneGuard will zone for it — the same computation (captured
// blocks of existing roads, predicted blocks of planned lanes, the game's depth rule, ≥ 2 columns) — as cell-aligned
// rectangles flush with the curb. The host plans around exactly those cells; ZoneGuard's later snap finds them as
// they are.
