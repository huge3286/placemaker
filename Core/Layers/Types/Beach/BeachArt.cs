// Art direction for the beach (art pass a3): explicit vanilla assets per style, used whenever the player
// left the matching asset control on automatic. Every list is vanilla (checked against the catalog dump);
// a playset without one of them falls back to the next id, then to the category pool (AutoAssets).
// Automatic pools are too broad for a beach: "beach.hut" resolves to a 40 m changing-room building and the
// lookout fallback of lifeguard towers to a 56 m fire-station upgrade, so neither is ever asked for here.
