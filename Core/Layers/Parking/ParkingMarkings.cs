// s53 — stall marking size.
//
// The vanilla stall decals (ParkingLotDecal01 / ParkingLotElectricDecal01) have a 3.2 x 6.2 m collision box on a 3.0 x 5.9 m
// stall, so every neighbouring pair overlapped and the game reported OverlapExisting. The marking is scaled to fit its stall
// (a hair inside it) so rows of stalls do not meet even without "Ignore collisions in my builds".
