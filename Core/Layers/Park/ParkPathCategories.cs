// Net categories of the park path hierarchy (grand park wave, g3): bike paths and dirt/gravel trails.
//
// Vanilla CS2 has no dedicated bicycle net in every build, and real prefab names are not curated yet
// (no catalog dump), so both tiers degrade gracefully: the layer emits the net with role PathwayWide /
// Pathway and an AUTOMATIC asset whose fallbacks are the likely prefab names below. AutoAssets picks
// the first fallback that is loaded; when none is, the ordinary pathway pool is used (a wide footpath
// for the bike route, a plain footpath for trails). A player can always pick an asset explicitly.
//
// Classification: the rules below tag nets by name. NOTE (docs/proposals/types-g3.md): today
// AssetHeuristics returns from its net branch before CategoryRules run, so these rules only take
// effect once the net branch also consults CategoryRules; until then the asset pickers for these
// categories may be empty and the name fallbacks do the work.
