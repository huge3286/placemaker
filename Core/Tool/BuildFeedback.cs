// Citymaker — what the player sees about the last build attempt (message + red markers).
//
// Playtest 1: a failed build left its red error markers on the map while the player started the
// next area. Rule (FEEDBACK-1 US8): the failure shows where and why, and everything about it
// disappears as soon as anything changes — area or design edit, stage change, a new build — and
// after a successful build. Pure so the flow is unit-tested (Tests/ToolBuildFlowTests.cs).
