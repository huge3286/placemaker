// Game runner: land made to order that arrives after launch (a queue session gets a scenario with "land" in its
// inbox). The plot is added east of the last one; this writes its ground into the live heightmap the way the launch
// would have, had the plot been there from the start, but only outside what is already laid out, so the grid, the
// earlier plots and every standing build keep their ground exactly.
