// Citymaker — turn resolved decals so their long side lies the way the plan meant (s21). GPL-3.0.
//
// Plans place decorative decals by intent: Yaw = the direction the decal's long axis should follow
// (path tangent, bay axis, shoreline, wheel line). Which prefab is used is decided later by the
// automatic resolver, and packs disagree on axes (a 2×6 puddle band is long in Z, a 10×5 tar patch or
// an 8×4 seaweed line is long in X). Run once per plan right after automatic assets are resolved (the
// game's AssetCatalogSystem.ResolveAutomatic, the gallery): a decal whose prefab is clearly longer in X
// is turned 90° so its long axis takes the planned direction. Round decals are left alone.
